This is the client SDK for Node.js, allowing you to build your own applications on top of Hyperledger FireFly.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @hyperledger/firefly-sdk
```

## Usage

```typescript
import FireFly from '@hyperledger/firefly-sdk';

async function main() {
  const firefly = new FireFly({ host: 'http://localhost:5000' });
  await firefly.sendBroadcast({
    data: [
      {
        value: 'test-message',
      },
    ],
  });
}

if (require.main === module) {
  main().catch((err) => console.error(`Error: ${err}`));
}
```

(This example was taken from the [examples](examples) folder where you will find some other basic samples)

## Generated schemas

The types for FireFly requests and responses are generated from the OpenAPI schema for FireFly. If you have
the `firefly` repository cloned in a folder parallel to this one, you can run the following to re-generate
the TypeScript interfaces from the latest FireFly definitions:

```bash
npm run schema
```
